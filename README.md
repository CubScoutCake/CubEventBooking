# Cub Scout CakePHP Booking System

This is part of the CubScoutCake Organisation.

The booking site is used for adding Leaders booking their sections onto events. It syncronises with Online Scout Manager and can output applications and invoices in PDFs.

The application also relies on SparkPost for SMTP transport.
