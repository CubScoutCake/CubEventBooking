<p>DebugKit provides a debugging toolbar and enhanced debugging tools for CakePHP applications.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>

<p>The <code>master</code> branch has the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>CakePHP 3.0.0 or greater.</li>
<li>PHP 5.4.16 or greater.</li>
<li>SQLite or another database driver that CakePHP can talk to. By default DebugKit will use SQLite, if you
 need to use a different database see the Database Configuration section below.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="debugkitforcakephp2.x">DebugKit for CakePHP 2.x</h2>

<p>If you want DebugKit for your 2.x application, you can use the latest <code>2.2.y</code> tag or the 2.2 branch.</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Install the plugin with composer from your CakePHP Project&#8217;s ROOT directory (where composer.json file is located)
<code>sh
php composer.phar require --dev cakephp/debug_kit &quot;~3.0&quot;
</code></p></li>
<li><p>Load the plugin
<code>php
Plugin::load('DebugKit', ['bootstrap' =&gt; true]);
</code></p></li>
<li><p>Set <code>'debug' =&gt; true,</code> in <code>config/app.php</code>.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="versions">Versions</h2>

<p>DebugKit has several releases, each compatible with different releases of
CakePHP. Use the appropriate version by downloading a tag, or checking out the
correct branch.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>1.0, 1.1, 1.2</code> are compatible with CakePHP 1.2.x. These releases of DebugKit
 will not work with CakePHP 1.3. You can also use the <code>1.2-branch</code> for the mos
 recent updates and bugfixes.</li>
<li><code>1.3.0</code> is compatible with CakePHP 1.3.x only. It will not work with CakePHP
 1.2. You can also use the <code>1.3</code> branch to get the most recent updates and
 bugfixes.</li>
<li><code>2.0.0</code> is compatible with CakePHP 2.0.x only. It will not work with previous
 CakePHP versions.</li>
<li><code>2.2.0</code> is compatible with CakePHP 2.2.0 and greater. It will not work with
 older versions of CakePHP as this release uses new API&#8217;s available in 2.2.
 You can also use the <code>master</code> branch to get the most recent updates.</li>
<li><code>2.2.x</code> are compatible with CakePHP 2.2.0 and greater. It is a necessary
 upgrade for people using CakePHP 2.4 as the naming conventions around loggers
 changed in that release.</li>
<li><code>3.0.x</code> is compatible with CakePHP 3.0.x and is still under active development.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="databaseconfiguration">Database Configuration</h2>

<p>By default DebugKit will store panel data into a SQLite database in your application&#8217;s <code>tmp</code>
directory. If you cannot install pdo_sqlite, you can configure DebugKit to use a different
database by defining a <code>debug_kit</code> connection in your <code>config/app.php</code> file.</p>

<h2 id="toolbarpanels">Toolbar Panels</h2>

<p>The DebugKit Toolbar is comprised of several panels, which are shown by clicking the
CakePHP icon in the upper right-hand corner of your browser after DebugKit has been
installed and loaded. Each panel is comprised of a panel class and view element.
Typically, a panel handles the collection and display of a single type of information
such as Logs or Request information. You can choose to panels from the toolbar or add
your own custom panels.</p>

<h3 id="built-inpanels">Built-in Panels</h3>

<p>There are several built-in panels, they are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Request</strong> Displays information about the current request, GET, POST, Cake
 Parameters, Current Route information and Cookies if the <code>CookieComponent</code>
 is in you controller&#8217;s components.</li>
<li><strong>Session</strong> Display the information currently in the Session.</li>
<li><strong>Timer</strong> Display any timers that were set during the request see
 <code>DebugKitDebugger</code> for more information. Also displays
 memory use at component callbacks as well as peak memory used.</li>
<li><strong>Sql Logs</strong> Displays sql logs for each database connection.</li>
<li><strong>Log</strong> Display any entries made to the log files this request.</li>
<li><strong>Variables</strong> Display View variables set in controller.</li>
<li><strong>Environment</strong> Display environment variables related to PHP + CakePHP.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>

<p>There is no configuration at this time. Configuration options will be coming soon.</p>

<h2 id="developingyourownpanels">Developing Your Own Panels</h2>

<p>You can create your own custom panels for DebugKit to help in debugging your applications.</p>

<h3 id="panelclasses">Panel Classes</h3>

<p>Panel Classes simply need to be placed in the <code>src/Panel</code> directory. The
filename should match the classname, so the class <code>MyCustomPanel</code> would be
expected to have a filename of <code>src/Panel/MyCustomPanel.php</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="php">namespace App\Panel;

use DebugKit\DebugPanel;

/**
 * My Custom Panel
 */
class MyCustomPanel extends DebugPanel {
        ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that custom panels are required to subclass the <code>DebugPanel</code> class.</p>

<h3 id="callbacks">Callbacks</h3>

<p>By default Panel objects have 2 callbacks, allowing them to hook into the
current request. Panels subscribe to the <code>Controller.initialize</code> and
<code>Controller.shutdown</code> events. If your panel needs to subscribe to additional
events, you can use the <code>implementedEvents</code> method to define all of the events
your panel is interested in.</p>

<p>You should refer to the built-in panels for some examples on how you can build panels.</p>

<h3 id="panelelements">Panel Elements</h3>

<p>Each Panel is expected to have a view element that renders the content from the
panel. The element name must be the underscored inflection of the class name.
For example <code>SessionPanel</code> has an element named <code>session_panel.ctp</code>, and
<code>SqllogPanel</code> has an element named <code>sqllog_panel.ctp</code>. These elements should be
located in the root of your <code>View/Elements</code> directory.</p>

<h4 id="customtitlesandelements">Custom Titles and Elements</h4>

<p>Panels should pick up their title and element name by convention. However, if you need to choose a custom element name or title, you can define methods to customize your panel&#8217;s behavior:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>title()</code> - Configure the title that is displayed in the toolbar.</li>
<li><code>elementName()</code> Configure which element should be used for a given panel.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="panelsinotherplugins">Panels in Other Plugins</h3>

<p>Panels provided by <a href="http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/plugins.html">Plugins</a>
work almost entirely the same as other plugins, with one minor difference: You
must set <code>public $plugin</code> to be the name of the plugin directory, so that the
panel&#8217;s Elements can be located at render time.</p>

<pre><code class="php">namespace MyPlugin\Panel;

use DebugKit\DebugPanel;

class MyCustomPanel extends DebugPanel {
    public $plugin = 'MyPlugin';
        ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>To use a plugin panel, update your application&#8217;s DebugKit configuration to include
the panel.</p>

<pre><code class="php">Configure::write(
    'DebugKit.panels',
    array_merge((array)Configure::read('DebugKit.panels'), ['MyPlugin.MyCustomPanel'])
);
</code></pre>

<p>The above would load all the default panels as well as the custom panel from <code>MyPlugin</code>.</p>

<h2 id="debugkitstorage">DebugKit Storage</h2>

<p>By default, DebugKit uses a small SQLite database in you application&#8217;s <code>/tmp</code> directory to store
the panel data. If you&#8217;d like DebugKit to store its data elsewhere, you should define a <code>debug_kit</code>
connection.</p>
